Alchemist-Common
================

`alchemist-common` is a collection of commonly used color-spaces and color-methods curated
for the `alchemist.js` color library. If you have an issue with any of the included
color-spaces or modifiers, please reference that individual plugin's repository.

Getting Started
---------------
To get started with `alchemist-common` it is recommended that use the version
that comes bundled with alchemist-js. If you would like to test nightly builds
or have other reasons to include it seperately, `alchemist-common` comes in
a couple other module formats:

- [npm package](https://github.com/webdesserts/alchemist-common)
- [UMD Module](/dist/)
- bundled by default with [alchemist-js](https://github.com/webdesserts/alchemist-js)

> decided on a set of defaults for alchemist-common. Look forward to seeing some
> added in the coming weeks.
